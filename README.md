# Inconsistent Firebase Realtime Database `onValue` Listener

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Firebase's Realtime Database `onValue` listener. The issue involves inconsistent updates across clients; data updates in the database, but not all clients receive the updates.

## Bug Description
Changes made to the Firebase Realtime Database are not reliably reflected in all connected clients using `onValue` listeners.  The database updates correctly, but some clients' listeners fail to trigger appropriately.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring proper data synchronization and handling of potential connection issues or listener detachments.  The solution code implements more robust error handling and reconnection strategies for the Firebase database connection.
